## Purpose

This project aims to create a Qt widget for inline editing of equations. The target is a code editor style rather than a document editor style (think Notepad++ with equations versus MS Word or LyX). Such an equation code editor could be used for:

* Computer algebra systems
* Symbolic math
* Scientific computing languages
* Mathematical scratchpads
* Online forums by compiling to WebAssembly

The name is perhaps overly self-deprecating; although there are many inline equation editors, there is not an abundance of open source options, and a Qt widget should be useful.

Probably the easiest way to interact with a Typeset::Edit in a separate project is to use the toCode() and setCode() methods. See the wiki page on [String Representation](https://github.com/JohnDTill/YAWYSIWYGEE/wiki/String-Representation) for an overview of the serialized format.
